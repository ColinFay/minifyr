<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of minifyr is to provide a wrapper around a NodeJS module, `node-minify` and `clean-css` <https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css>

## Installation

You can install the released version of `{minifyr}` with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("colinfay/minifyr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(minifyr)
minifyr_npm_install(TRUE)
minifyr_run("test.css", "test2.css")
```
